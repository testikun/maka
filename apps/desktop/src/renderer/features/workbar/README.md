# Workbar feature

Workbar is a vertical renderer feature. Its application-level model owns the
right/bottom panel topology, active tabs, dimensions and persisted collapse
state. Tool data remains session-scoped. The content surface is remounted when
navigation leaves the linked Session scope; within that scope tools receive a
new `sessionId` in place and must reset any session-derived data themselves.

## Dependency direction

- Consumers import production APIs from `features/workbar`.
- Node test suites may additionally import `features/workbar/testing`.
- Storybook may additionally import `features/workbar/stories`, which exposes
  `WorkbarSurface`. It stays out of the production entry because `workbar-host`
  reaches the surface through `lazy()`, and out of `testing` because that entry
  is loaded by `node --test` against tsc output while the surface and its tool
  panels use extensionless relative specifiers only a bundler resolves.
- Workbar may use shared renderer primitives, core types and Maka UI.
- Workbar must not import shell composition, Desktop bridge, or main-process implementation.
- Desktop I/O enters through `WorkbarServices`; tool code does not read
  the Desktop global bridge directly.
- `useWorkbarController` is the application boundary for topology, shortcuts,
  dynamic resources and Side Chat visibility. `AppShell` supplies only the
  active Session, workspace availability, authoritative Session ids, shell visibility and composer
  mention/model context.

## Public surface

- `host` is passed intact to `<WorkbarHost model={workbar.host} />`.
- `commands.openTool`, `commands.openSideChatWithQuote` and
  `commands.toggleRight` are the only shell actions.
- `selectors.rightCollapsed` drives the titlebar restore affordance and
  `selectors.hiddenSessionIds` filters ephemeral companion forks from the rail.

## Lifecycle invariants

- Review, Work Board, Browser, Files and Inspector tabs are persisted globally.
- Terminal and Side Chat tabs and their resource metadata are transient.
- `WORKBAR_TOOL_DEFINITIONS` is the authority for persistence, singleton
  behavior, default placement, icon and shortcut; storage, controller and UI
  code consume it rather than maintaining parallel kind lists.
- A face is opened and closed only from the strip's `[+]` menu, which lists
  every registered tool and marks the open ones. Tabs carry no close control:
  `Tab` renders `endContent` inside its own `<button>`, so a per-tab close
  would nest a button in a button. Tabs are never reordered, so the strip's
  order is the order the faces were opened in.
- How many Terminals or Side Chats exist is each face's own business; only a
  deliberate open adds a tab.
- Closing or leaving the owner session stops Terminal resources.
- A Terminal start is tagged with its source generation. If it resolves after
  a Session switch or controller disposal, the returned resource is stopped
  immediately and never enters the tab topology.
- Terminal ownership is registered as soon as `start` returns, before the tab
  state commits. Host projection excludes resources owned by another Session,
  so a Session switch cannot briefly reattach an old Terminal.
- Side Chat survives panel collapse and navigation from its source Session to
  linked descendants; it is cleaned when its tab closes or navigation leaves
  that source/descendant scope.
- Disposed Side Chat operations are fenced at every fork/send boundary; a late
  fork is cleaned and a late send cannot write back into an abandoned panel.
- Inactive tabs stay mounted; their hooks receive the existing active/hidden
  signal and decide whether to subscribe.
- Inspector keeps two authorities separate: Session events refresh its paged
  timeline/context window, while usage-change events refresh the complete
  Session usage summary. Re-activation and head refresh preserve the requested
  trace page depth.

## Adding a tool

Add its metadata, define the smallest service port it needs, implement its hook
and surface under `tools/`, register fake-service story states, and pin both its
state transitions and resource cleanup in tests.
